# Password_Generator

## Description
Hello everyone, this is a project of my implementation of a password generator program.
The application runs on Windows in the system console.
It was written in C++ using the C17 standard.
The program allows you to generate a password with a given length in the range of 8 to 64 characters.
The program generates a password consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.


## Technologise

* C++ in C17 standard,
* Git.

## Instalation
* Clone the repository to your own computer.
* If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio, in the project properties specify the path to the header files ```C:\...\$(ProjectName)\inc```
* (OPTIONAL) Recommended to set the following paths for building the application.
	* Output directory: ```$(SolutionDir)bin\$(Platform)\$(configuration)\```
	* Intermediate directory: ```$(SolutionDir)bin\intermediates\$(Platform)\$(configuration)\```
* Now you can compile the code.

## Thanks
Thank you to everyone who has reached this point.
I count on your opinions and comments on the solutions that I have adopted in this program.
